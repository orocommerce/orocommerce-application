OroCommerce Sample Application
==============================

What is OroCommerce?
--------------------

OroCommerce is an open-source Business to Business Commerce application built with flexibility in mind.
OroCommerce can be customized and extended to fit any B2B commerce needs.

## Requirements

OroCommerce is a Symfony 2 based application with the following requirements:

* PHP 5.5.9 or above
* PHP 5.5.9 or above with command line interface
* PHP Extensions
    * GD
    * Mcrypt
    * JSON
    * ctype
    * Tokenizer
    * SimpleXML
    * PCRE
    * ICU
* MySQL 5.1 or above
* PostgreSQL 9.1 or above

## Installation instructions

### Using Composer

This OroCommerce application uses both [Composer][1] and [Git Submodules][5] to manage its dependencies, this is the recommended way to install the application.

 - If you do not have Composer yet, download it and follow the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

OroCommerce uses [fxpio/composer-asset-plugin][10] to manage dependency on third-party asset libraries. The plugin has to be installed globally (per user):
 
```bash
composer global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:~1.2"
```

- Clone https://github.com/orocommerce/orocommerce-application.git repository with

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/orocommerce/orocommerce-application.git
```

- Make sure that you have [NodeJS][2] installed

- Install project dependencies with Composer. If the installation process is too slow, you can use the "--prefer-dist" option.
  Run Composer installation:

```bash
php composer.phar install --prefer-dist
```

- Create the database with the name specified in the previous step (the default name is "b2b_dev").

- Install application and admin user with Installation Wizard by opening install.php in the browser or from CLI:

```bash
php app/console oro:install --env prod
```
**Note:** If the installation process times out, add the `--timeout=0` argument to the command.

- Enable WebSockets messaging

```bash
php app/console clank:server --env prod
```

- Configure crontab or scheduled tasks execution to run the command below every minute:

```bash
php app/console oro:cron --env prod
```

- Launch the message queue consumption:

```bash
php app/console oro:message-queue:consume --env prod
```

**Note:** ``app/console`` is a path from project root folder. Please make sure you are using the full path for crontab configuration or if you are running console command from a different location.

## Upgrading

If you're upgrading from existing, older beta versions please issue the following commands in the `application/commerce` folder:

```bash
composer install
app/console oro:platform:update --force
```

The database will be migrated into the latest state.

Note that if you want to preserve images from the old version, you need to copy the `app/attachments` folder from the previous installation.

## Installation notes

Installed PHP Accelerators must be compatible with Symfony and Doctrine (support DOCBLOCKs)

Note that the port used in Websocket must be open in firewall for outgoing/incoming connections

Using MySQL 5.6 on HDD is potentially risky because of performance issues

Recommended configuration for this case:

    innodb_file_per_table = 0

Ensure that timeout has default value

    wait_timeout = 28800

See [Optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O][3] for more information.

The default MySQL character set utf8 uses a maximum of three bytes per character and contains only BMP characters. The [utf8mb4][6] character set uses a maximum of four bytes per character and supports supplemental characters (e.g. emojis). It is [recommended][7] to use utf8mb4 character set in your app/config.yml:

```
...
doctrine:
    dbal:
        connections:
            default:
                driver:       "%database_driver%"
                host:         "%database_host%"
                port:         "%database_port%"
                dbname:       "%database_name%"
                user:         "%database_user%"
                password:     "%database_password%"
                charset:      utf8mb4
                default_table_options:
                    charset: utf8mb4
                    collate: utf8mb4_unicode_ci
                    row_format: dynamic
...
```

Using utf8mb4 might have side effects. MySQL indexes have a default limit of 767 bytes, so any indexed fields with varchar(255) will fail when inserted, because utf8mb4 can have 4 bytes per character (255 * 4 = 1020 bytes), thus the longest data can be 191 (191 * 4 = 764 < 767). To be able to use any 4 byte charset all indexed varchars should be at most varchar(191). To overcome the index size issue the server can be configured to have large index size by enabling [sysvar_innodb_large_prefix][7]. However, innodb_large_prefix requires some additional settings to work:

- innodb_default_row_format=DYNAMIC (you may also enable it per connection as in the config above)
- innodb_file_format=Barracuda
- innodb_file_per_table=1 (see above performance issues with this setting)

More details about this issue can be read [here][9]

## PostgreSQL installation notes

You need to load `uuid-ossp` extension for proper doctrine's `guid` type handling.
Log into database and run sql query:

```
CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";
```

## Web Server Configuration

The OroCommerce sample application is based on the Symfony standard application, so the web server configuration recommendations are the [same][4].
